\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\par In this laboratory assignment we shall study and assemble a Operational Amplifier (OP-AMP). Our goal is to implement a band pass filter (BPF) whose central frequency is 1000 Hz, and aim for a gain of 40 dB.

\par The merit of our work is given by equation \ref{eq:merit}.



\begin{equation}
    M = \frac{1}{cost ( voltagegaindeviation + centralfrequencydeviation + 10^{-6}}
    \label{eq:merit}
\end{equation}

The analysis of this circuit was made recurring to a simulation software, \emph{Ngspice}, this is presented in section \ref{sec:simulation}, and through a theoretical analysis, this is presented in section \ref{sec:theoretical}. We will then compare the results obtained and conclude about the use of either analysis.
