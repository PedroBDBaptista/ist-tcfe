\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\par Comparing the results from the simulation with the ones gotten from the theoretical analysis, we can conclude that they match, in an overall way, presenting erros below 4\%.

\par One can notice in figure \ref{fig:Gaincomparison} that the simulation gain drops faster than it's theoretical conterpart. This is due to the effect of the non-ideal Op-Amp, which showed an upper cutoff frequency , as mentioned before. Furthermore, the Op-Amp's attenuation rate is larger than the one caused by the lowpass filter stage, surpassing its effect for higher enough frequencies, resulting in a change in the response's slope, visible in figure \ref{fig:Ngspicegain(f)} around frequency $f = 1 MHz$.

\par We can also notice that the output impedance is somewhat larger than desirable. The output impedance obtained through the simulation is greater than the theoretical one, was expected since the second one considers an ideal model where the OpAmp's impedance is null.

\par Computing the deviation from the desirable frequency and the desirable gain we can compute the Merit of our work: $M=2.57\times 10^{-4}$.
